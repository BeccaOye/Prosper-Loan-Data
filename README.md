# Prosper-Loan-Data
## by (Rebecca Oyetunji)


## Dataset

> The Prosper loan data contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. Proper description were found during the pre-wrangling stage to using .shape,.dtypes, .describe to see the type and structure of the dataset. Most of the variable of  interest were easy to identify after this was done.

## Summary of Findings

>The univariate plots explored counts and distribution of loan status, occupation, income range, Employment status, interest and loan terms.
The bivariate plot compared the target variable, loan status to interest rate, income range and loan terms using point plots, violin plot, scatter plot, bar plots, histograms.
The multivariate further explored these relationships and confirmed them, this was done by comparing loan status to income range and loan term using a multivariate bar plot and confirming the relationship further with two other scatterplots used differently.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> This presentation will explain the observations between income range and loan status, loan term and interest rate, it will also explain relationships between loan status and interest rate.
I've made sure to use different color palettes for each quality variable to make sure it is clear that they're different between plots.
